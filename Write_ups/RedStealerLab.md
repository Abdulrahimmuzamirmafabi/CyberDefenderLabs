# Scenario

You are part of the Threat Intelligence team in the SOC (Security Operations Center). An executable file has been discovered on a colleague's computer, and it's suspected to be linked to a Command and Control (C2) server, indicating a potential malware infection.
Your task is to investigate this executable by analyzing its hash. The goal is to gather and analyze data beneficial to other SOC members, including the Incident Response team, to respond to this suspicious behavior efficiently.
